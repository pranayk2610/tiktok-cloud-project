literally heart broken right now because of signed of mine just reached out and said a 
thirteen year old girl he knows committed suicide because of this app she made a video saying she was 
feeling depressed and these kids got on there and started commenting bullying her saying she should 
just end her life and she actually listened to them to end up killing herself because of his bowling 
shoes experiencing and i just have to save this christian is so important i can't emphasize it 
enough and i know it's no secret to any of you guys but this app if you scroll for two minutes 
you're gonna see some nasty demonic video this app is full of darkness as christians it is our 
little responsibility to be the hands and feet of jesus to people who may never s
et foot in a church but they'll scroll through your videos of your heart is 
saying right now when it encourage you to use your voice for god don't be silent it 
literally could be life or death for people
