don't scroll this is going to be the most important video you watch all day I'm really 
heartbroken right now because a friend of mine just reached out and said a thirteen year 
old girl he knows committed suicide because of this app she made a video saying she was 
feeling depressed and these kids got on there and started commenting bullying her saying 
she should just and her life and she actually listen to them did the killing herself because 
of this bowling she's experiencing and I just have to say this as Christians our rule on this 
app is so important I can't emphasize that enough and I know it's no secret to any of you guys 
that this app if you scroll for two minutes you're gonna see some nasty demonic video this app is 
full of darkness as Christians it was our little responsibility 
to be the hands and feet of Jesus to people who may never set foot in a church but they will scroll 
through your videos if your heart is what I'm saying right now I want to encourage you to use your 
voice for god don't be silent it literally could be life or death for people
