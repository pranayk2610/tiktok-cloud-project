okay guys my son's school had a fire truck come out to spray the entire kids 
with water and they could have a water play date they said to us 
send em in whatever clothes you want shorts and tshirts and 
you know whatever they want to wear just not a swimsuit and 
they can get wet just send a change of clothes 
I sent him in some sweats and I sent him in a tshirt 
every single kid was able to get in the water and play except for my son 
he came home crying so this is what I did
