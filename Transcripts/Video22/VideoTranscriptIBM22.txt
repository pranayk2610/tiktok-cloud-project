okay guys my son's school had a fire truck come out to spray the entire kids 
with water and they can have a water play date they said to us 
cinema whatever clothes you want shorts and T. shirts and 
you know whatever they want to wear just not a swimsuit and 
they can get wet to send a change of clothes 
I sent them in some sweats and I sent him a teacher 
every single kid was able to get in the water and place that for my son 
he came home crying so this is what I did
