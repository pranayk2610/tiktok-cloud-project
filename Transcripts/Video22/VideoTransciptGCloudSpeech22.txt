okay guys my son school had a fire truck come out to spray the entire kids with water and they can have a water play day they said to do whatever you want shorts and t-shirts and you do whatever they want to wear just not a swimsuit and they can get wet to spend a change of clothes I sent them in some sweats and I sent him an AT&T store every single kid was able to get in the water and then play except for my son he came home crying so this is what I did
