option it's not an option you need to always stand up yourself that people learn to not walk all over you because they know that you're going to defend yourself number to there's a misconception that when you stand up for yourself you need to bring down the other person you never look good trying to make someone else look bad number 3 you need to stand up for yourself face-to-face with that person in real life don't post with that person on your Snapchat story that's not standing up for yourself that's making a big deal if someone was talking bad about me behind my back I can I talk to you for a moment yeah I saw they were talking bad about me behind my back and posting about me you need to stop you don't even know me
