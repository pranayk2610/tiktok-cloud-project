listen nobody talks about the bullying that pretty girls go through like growing up I did not know that you get bullied just because you're pretty and I grew up very insecure thinking that something was wrong with me like how I thought I was ugly I thought it was hard to hear the words you're beautiful for a long time even if my hood because I didn't know that was the reason we're going to a new school and girls wanted to fight me they don't like me for no reason I never had a conversation with them they just don't like me and somebody a girl who actually came up to me and told me she was like they don't like you because you're beautiful before that moment had never hit me that that was the reason and that also.
