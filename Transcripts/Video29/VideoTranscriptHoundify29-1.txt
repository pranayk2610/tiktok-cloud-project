listen nobody talks about the bullying that pretty girls go through like growing up i did not know that you get bullied just because you're pretty and i grew up very insecure thinking that something was wrong with me laid out i thought i was ugly but it was hard to hear the words you're beautiful for a long time even at my dog because i didn't know that was a reason and i'm never going to school and someone they don't like you because you're beautiful before that moment had never hit me that that was the reason
