listen nobody talks about the bullying that pretty girls go through like growing up 
i did not know that you get bullied just because you're pretty and i grew up very 
insecure thinking that something was wrong with me laid out i thought i was ugly 
but it was hard to hear the words you're beautiful for a long time even at my dog 
because i didn't know 
that was a reason and i'm never gonna lose school and girls wanted to 
fight me they don't like me for no reason i never had a conversation with 
them and someone they don't like you because you're beautiful before that 
moment had never hit me that that was the reason and then also travel 
friendly talk to anyone i'm confident i don't care like i will give you 
a compliment like that it's a lot of women like you some pretty girls 
have to be still
