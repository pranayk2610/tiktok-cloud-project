listen nobody talks about the bullying that pretty girls go through like
growing up I did not know that you get bullied just because you're pretty and I grew up 
very insecure thinking that something was wrong with me like I thought I was ugly 
I genuinely thought it was hard to hear the words you're beautiful for a long time even in my adulthood
because I didn't know that was the reason and I remember going to a new school 
and girls wanted to fight me they didn't like me for no reason I never had a 
conversation with them they just didn't like me and somebody a girl actually came 
up to me and told me she was like they don't like you because you're beautiful 
and before that moment it had never hit me that that was the reason and that also 
travels into adulthood because you I'm friendly I talk to anyone 
I'm confident I don't care like I will give you a compliment in a quick second 
but there's a lot of women theres not like that theres a lot of women that will turn their nose up 
at you beef with you not like you so pretty girls you have to be stiff you have to be
