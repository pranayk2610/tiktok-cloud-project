my door off um and tried to act like he didn't do anything um I was painting 
an easel and I used to have a doorstop here uh a blanket he's thrown 
it up here um I used to have a bunch of stuff on here as you can see he's 
tossed it all to the side um he also used to have a PS4 um a video game system that was 
right here and he put a note I hope you can take some time to enjoy your 
family we are here for you and we always have been here he ripped out my PS4 and 
decided to take out the game with it as well cuz he thought that would be 
helpful
