I was bullied in high school for being gay no surprise there but between my sophomore and 
junior year I finally came out as a lesbian and I finally admitted to myself yes I was gay 
and of course when you admit that you're gay all the religious assholes decide to come out and 
tell you that you are going to hell trust me I already knew I was going to hell 
but it wasn't because of the queerness it was
because of the shit that I would say and do but anyways there was one bitch in particular and yes I 
meant bitch when I said it um that made my life a living hell you hear the volume at 
which my voice is at right now and fun fact she sat three feet away from me calling me gay slurs 
in front of the teacher during lesson and the teacher goes oh I didn't here it 
go fuck yourself I still hate that teacher fuck you and if your a teacher like that 
double fuck you you're part of the problem so I went up to the principal told the principal 
she was gay she was like I'll handle it she did the best that she could and said Hey 
talked to her parents and her and said if it continues she's getting 
suspended and maybe even expelled cuz I do not handle that shit at my school that's 
zero tolerance I said ah well then you might want to tell to Ms B. because she's tolerating it 
a lot in class bitch you are lucky I'm not outting you for your full fucking name right now anyways 
it continued so then after the next math class I had gone home and told my mom like she is still calling me 
gays slurs mom just looked at me and says hmm
sounds like it's time to be to beat some ass mom I can get suspended for that does it look 
like I give a fuck no the next time she starts in go ape shit beat the ever living fuck out of her you better 
have two people pulling you off to get you to stop yes ma'am
