I was bullied in high school for being a no surprise there but between my sophomore and 
junior year I finally came out as a lesbian and I finally admitted to myself yes I was gay 
and of course when you met that you're gay all the religious Hoskins said to come out and 
tell you they are going to help trust me I was going to hell it wasn't because the clearances 
because the **** that I would say and do but anyway there's one version particular and yes I 
met **** when I said it %HESITATION that made my life a living hell you hear the volume at 
which my voice is at right now and fun fact she sat three feet away from me call me gay slurs 
in front of the teacher during lesson and the teacher goes whitening here it 
go **** yourself I still think that teacher **** you and if your teacher like that 
double **** you you're part of the problem so I went up to the principal told the principal 
she was gang she's like I'll handle it she did the best that she could and said Hey I talked to her parents and her and said if it continues she's getting 
suspended and maybe even expelled because I do not handle that **** at my school that's 
zero tolerance that's all well then you might want to come is B. because she's tiring it
