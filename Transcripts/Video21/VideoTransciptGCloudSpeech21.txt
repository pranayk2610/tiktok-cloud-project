I was bullied in high school for being gay. No surprise there but between my sophomore and junior year 
I finally came out as lesbian and I finally admitted to myself yes I was gay and of course when you met 
that you're gay all the religious tassels come out and tell you that you're going to hell because of my 
life a living hell you hear the volume at which my voice is that right now and fun fact she sat three feet 
away from me call me gay slurs in front of the teacher during lesson and a teacher goes why didn't he go fuc 
yourself I still ain't that teacher fuck you and if you're a teacher like that double fuck you you're part of 
the problem so I went up to the principal told the principal she was gay because like I'll handle it she did 
the best that she could and said hey I'll talk to her parents and her and said if it continues she's 
getting suspended and maybe even expelled cuz I do not handle that shitt at my school has a zero-tolerance 
because she's tearing it a lot in class that you are lucky I'm not outing you for your full fucking in right 
now anyways it continued so that after the next math class I had gone home and told my mom I like cheese store, 
gay slurs mom just like the Mingos sounds like it's time to beat some ass mama I could get suspended for 
that does it look like I give a fuk know the next time she starts in go ape shitt beat the ever-living 
fuck out her you better have two people pointing off to get Mewtwo stop
