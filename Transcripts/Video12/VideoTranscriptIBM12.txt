if you've ever been asked before I got into an argument with an 
extremely toxic person what should like honestly be all of you 
which is sad but true and you really need to hear this because 
I'm about to make everything click for you when someone hits you 
with that good old after everything I've done for you they're actually 
revealing a little secret but they're actually saying is that everything 
they've done for you in the past wasn't actually for you at all it wasn't 
none of the kindness of their hearts or because of their so called love for 
you their so called the generosity was really just stemming from their need 
and desire to control you
