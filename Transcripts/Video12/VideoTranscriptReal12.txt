if you've ever been gaslit before or got into an argument with an 
extremely toxic person which should like honestly be all of you 
which is sad but true then you really need to hear this because 
I'm about to make everything click for you when someone hits you 
with that good old after everything I've done for you they're actually 
revealing a little secret what they're actually saying is that everything 
they've done for you in the past wasn't actually for you at all it wasn't 
done out of the kindness of their hearts or because of their so called love for 
you their so called  generosity was really just stemming from their need 
and desire to control you
