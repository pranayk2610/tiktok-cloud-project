this is my official statement %HESITATION if I am ever found dead or end up 
missing between today April twenty ninth of twenty twenty one up until 
you find me or I am missing my ex boyfriend is the one who killed me or 
I just got done with my court trial where I filed a no contact order 
against my ex boyfriend and the judge threw it away 
he physically and emotionally mentally abused me for two 
years and he also has a weapon and if people ever wonder if any of you ever 
wonder why victims of domestic violence or rape or assault do not come 
forward this is why **** the justice system and everybody a part of it
