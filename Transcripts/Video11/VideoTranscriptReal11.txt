this is my official statement um if I am ever found dead or end up 
missing between today April twenty ninth of twenty twenty one up until 
you find me or I am missing my ex boyfriend is the one who killed me or kidnapped me 
I just got done with my court trial where I filed a no contact order 
against my ex boyfriend and the judge threw it away 
he physically and emotionally mentally abused me for two 
years and he also has a weapon and if people ever wonder if any of you ever 
wonder why victims of domestic violence or rape or assault do not come 
forward this is why fuck the justice system and everybody a part of it
