this is my official statement if I am ever found dead or end up missing between today April 29th of 2021 up until you find me or I am missing my ex boyfriend is the one who killed me or kidnapped me I just got done with my court trial when I filed a no contact order against my ex boyfriend and the judge threw it away he physically and emotionally mentally abused me for two years and he also has a weapon and if people ever wonder if any of you ever wonder why victims of domestic violence or rape or assault do not come forward this is why suck the justice system and everybody apart of it
