Sissy Missy we are talking about how the heck you're gonna stand up for yourself 
becayse we do not let anyone anyone walk all over us so welcome to the first episode of 
how to with Spencer Vu  and we are going to be talking about standing up for 
ourselves okay number one and the most important stop making standing up for yourself an 
option it's not an option you need to always stand up for yourself so that people 
learn to not walk all over you because they know that you're going to defend 
yourself number two there's a misconception that when you stand up yourself 
you need to bring down the other person you never look good trying to make someone else look bad 
number three you need to stand up for yourself face to face with that person in real 
life don't post about that person on your Snapchat story that's not standing up for yourself 
that's making a big deal here's an example of if someone was talking bad about me behind my back 
hi can I talk to you for a moment yeah I saw that you were talking bad about me behind my back 
and posting about me you need to stop you don't even know me 
there you go
