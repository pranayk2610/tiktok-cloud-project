sissy missy we're talking about how the heck you're gonna stand up for yourself 
because we do not let anyone anyone walk all over us and so welcome to the first episode of 
how to expensive food and we are going to be talking about standing up for ourselves okay 
number one and the most important stop making standing up for yourself an option it's not an option 
you need to always stand up for yourselves that people learned to not walk all over you because they know 
that you're going to defend yourself number two there's a misconception that when you stand up for yourself 
you need to bring down the other person you never look good trying to make someone else look bad never three 
you need to stand up yourself face-to-face with that person in real life don't post with that person on your 
snapchat story that's not standing up for yourself that's making a big deal here is an example of if someone 
was talking bad about me behind my back hi can i talk to you for a moment yeah i saw they were talking about 
me behind my back and posting about me you need to stop you don't even know me
