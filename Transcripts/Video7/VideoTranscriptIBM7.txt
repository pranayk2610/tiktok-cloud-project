so I'm fifteen and I have my first boyfriend eventually my mom finds out 
about him because he's calling our house all the time I didn't have a cell 
phone yeah she wasn't against me dating she just you know wanted to meet him 
obviously not having him overcame with rules normal rules that if I had
a daughter I would enforce no boys in your bedroom with the door close no boys 
over when your parents aren't home normal **** like that I wasn't hearing it though 
because I was day why would I haven't come to my mom's where there's rules when
I can just haven't come to my dad's and we could just be in the basement with 
the door closed so now I'm grown  you can't tell me nothin I drink alcohol I smoke weed 
I smoke cigarettes I have a boyfriend who has a car I've had sacks
