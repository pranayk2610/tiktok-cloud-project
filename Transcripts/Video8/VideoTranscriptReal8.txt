starting at just the age of three years old this man started making my life a 
living hell karma's finally starting to pay him back that's his mugshot finally 
at the age of eight years old I was walking home from school I saw a cat in a canal 
I saved it took it home blowdried it don't know why he came home and decided to 
beat the shit out of me after he told me go wait for my punishment made my 
face black and blue and all bloody all of a sudden something snapped and he said 
go outside and go play 
like nothing had happened I went over to my friend's house they 
called CPS turned him in cops came  everything else I was removed 
from the home and told he had to leave two weeks later that man came 
back into the house that my friends is how they used to deal with freaking 
child abuse they did nothing 
now he's being turned in for beating the shit out of his girlfriend 
hopefully they do more because till this day I have PTSD and can't stand cats
