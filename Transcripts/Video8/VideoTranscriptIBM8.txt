starting at just the age of three years old this man started making my life a 
living hell karma's finally starting to pay him back that's his mugshot finally 
at age eight years old I was walking home from school I saw a cat and a canal 
I saved it to get onboard credit down the line he came home and decided to 
beat the **** out of me after he told me go away from my punishment may my 
face black and blue and all ability I'll send something snapped and he said 
go outside and go play 
like nothing happened I went over to my friend's house they 
called CPS turned them in cubs game everything else I was removed 
from the home until he had to leave two weeks later that man came 
back into the house that my friends is how they used to deal with freaking 
child abuse they did nothing 
now he's being turned in for beating the **** out of his girlfriend 
hopefully do more because till this day I have PTSD and can't stand cats
