so I allowed my mom to follow me on here but due to her Perpetual harassment I decided to block her I've been informed her of the block and her response was well vulgar so and this is her response to be harassment continue take your time take your time deep breaths okay I didn't went to go talk to the woman herself in person and she began to throw a tantrum as if she were I don't know 5 years old which led me to unblock her because I could not stand the whining and also I wanted her to take me to Starbucks
