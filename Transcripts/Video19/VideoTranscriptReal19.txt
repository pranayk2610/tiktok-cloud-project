so i allowed my mom to follow me on here but due to her perpetual 
harassment i decided to block her i then informed her of the block 
and her response was well vulgar so and this is her response the 
harassment continues take your time take your time deep breaths ok i then 
went to go talk to the woman herself in person and she began to throw a 
tantrum as if she were i don't know five years old which led me to 
unblock her because i could not stand the whining and also I wanted
her to take me to starbucks
