so i allowed my mom to follow me on here but due to her perpetual harassment i decided to block her i've been informed her of the block and her response was well vulgar so and this is her response to the harassment continues take your time take your time deep breaths ok i didn't went to go talk to the woman herself in person and she began to throw a tantrum as if she were i don't know five years old which led me to unblock her because i could not stand the whining and also the one in her to take me to starbucks
