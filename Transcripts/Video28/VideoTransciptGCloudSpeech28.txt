when I was younger I went to cancer Camp over the summer and they made us have like a nickname cuz I don't want anyone knowing me our real names and stuff so I was 11 years old I was reading Harry Potter for the first time so I named myself for Crocs and that was my nickname for all six years but the kids there didn't really know what that was so then they started to believe me and they started calling me for skok so for six years I was bullied a cancer campaign called horse cart
