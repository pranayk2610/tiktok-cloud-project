so I was stopped using GPS and Bluetooth and a lot of people don't know about Bluetooth attack so I wanted to take a minute to let you know more about them this type of attack is called bluesnarfing bluesnarfing yes you heard me so Bluetooth is turned on on your phone and you have it set to discoverable theoretically you could be at risk for this the attacker can get your text messages your pictures your emails your calendar your contacts and a bunch of other stuff the sleeves victims of abuse and you very very vulnerable place so I recommend keeping your Bluetooth off when you're not using it and also make sure that it can't be discovered because you don't want to end up like me and have apple tell you that you need to replace your iPhone account and everything else
