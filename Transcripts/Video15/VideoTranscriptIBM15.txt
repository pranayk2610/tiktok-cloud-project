so I was stopped using GPS and Bluetooth and a lot of people don't know about
Bluetooth attacks so wanted to take a minute to let you know more about them this 
type of attack is called blue star theme blue starving yes you heard me 
so Bluetooth is turned on on your phone and you have it set to discoverable theoretically 
you could be at risk for this the attacker can get your text messages your pictures your emails 
your calendar your contacts and a bunch of other stuff this leaves victims of abuse any very very 
vulnerable place so I recommend keeping your Bluetooth off when you're not using it and also make 
sure that it can't be discovered because you don't want to end up like me and have apple tell you that 
you need to replace your iPhone %HESITATION phone account and everything else
