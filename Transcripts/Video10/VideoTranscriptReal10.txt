mommy the dogs can't go out or they'll eat it
it's like one o'clock in the morning
and this is what I have to clean up this is what domestic violence looks like literally
my kids are up and it's one thirty in the morning and they have school baby 
go to bed 
this is this is not okay just go to bed this 
put that back, stop put it back, i'm cleaning
