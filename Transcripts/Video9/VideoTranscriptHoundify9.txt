you need to explain to me right now why the hell my sons out there his face is bleeding and you look perfectly fine and that's what happens when you throw somebody into a kitchen counter so i don't really know what it is that you want to say to you right now you know what no because at the end of the day like i hear the conversations you guys have every night and to be quite honest i'm shocked at this the first time that this is ever happened he is a man you need to understand that at the end of the day he is a man so what he says goes what he does goes so he hits you and it is what it is like you just need to accept that you know what you don't have to worry about that anymore we don't gotta worry about it anymore that's a good idea
