so my ten year old daughter came home from school yesterday really 
upset why because kids were making fun of her why because of her 
headphones she got these for christmas bling at all and she's 
really proud of it and loves it but now she feels like she cannot
 bring them to school because these kids are telling her that they are 
 only for babies now my daughter has some mental delays and intellectual 
 disabilities and she really internalizes things like this i've always taught my 
 kids to be decent human beings and have respect and kindness for others no matter 
 what even doing fourteen days of school this month
