so my ten year old daughter came home from school yesterday really upset 
why because kids are making fun of her why because of her headphones now she 
got these for Christmas bling and all and she's really proud of them 
and loves them but now she feels like she can not bring them to school
because these kids are telling her that they are only for babies now my daughter
has some mental delays and intellectual disabilities and she really internalizes
things like this I've always taught my kids to be decent human beings and have 
respect and kindness for others no matter what they're even doing fourteen days of kindness 
at school this month and some parents just don't 
have the same values so if your kid has this please duet me so I can show her how cool 
she is and for the love of god teach your kids to have respect and stop bullying thanks 
for coming to my Ted talk
