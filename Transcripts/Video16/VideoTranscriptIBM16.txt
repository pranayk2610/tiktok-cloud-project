so my ten year old daughter came home from school yesterday really upset 
why because kids are making fun of her why because of our headphones there she 
got these for Christmas blowing it out and she's really press 
and loves it but now she feels like she can not bring them to school
because these kids are telling her that they are only for babies now my daughter
has some mental delays and intellectual disabilities and she really internalizes
things like this I've always taught my kids to be decent human beings and have 
respect and kindness for others no matter what it they're even doing fourteen days 
of kindness at school this month in some parents just don't
