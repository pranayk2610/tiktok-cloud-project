so you may have seen an experiment where someone took two plants but nicely 21 and mean words to the other and they saw that the ones that they spoke rudely to started dying faster didn't do very well where the one that they spoke nicely to thrived and grew so I want to put this to the test because why not and we'll see how it goes so I have two of the same plants this one I'm going to be nice to this one I'm going to views so keep in mind I'm not a plant mom obviously these are in cups they both might die but it's going to be fun along the way hopefully it's a girl you're going to grow up so beautifully and so strong I love you so much you're so wonderful you stupid fucking piece of shit no one's ever loved you
