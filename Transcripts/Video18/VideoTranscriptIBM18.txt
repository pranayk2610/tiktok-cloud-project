so you may have seen an experiment where someone took two plants spoke nicely to one and mean words 
to the other and they saw that the ones that they spoke rudely to started dying faster didn't do very 
well where the one that they spoke nicely to thrived and grew so I want to put this to the test because 
why not and %HESITATION we'll see how it goes so I have to the same plants %HESITATION this one is going 
to be nice to this one I'm going to abuse so keep in mind I'm not a plant mom obviously these are in cups they both might die but it's gonna be fun along 
the way hopefully a girl you're going to grow up so beautifully and so strong I love you so much you're 
so wonderful you stupid **** piece of **** no one's ever loved you and I hope you die alone in the **** 
street I'm I just tossed you right outside the **** window you're so god damn ugly looking your **** leave 
this one's bucking cradling the **** is wrong with you you
