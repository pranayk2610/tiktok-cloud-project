okay I just want to get on here and say thank you to everyone for all of your love 
and your support and I didn't expect the video to reach as many people as a dad I just 
I didn't want to stay silent anymore but I still don't and for those of you asking for 
an update we were all we've been out  the night that it happened and he got arrested 
and he's in jail he still currently in jail and when it all happened we've moved out 
like that but like I have it I didn't sleep for like two days because I just I was so 
scared and I just wanted out of there like I didn't want I cut it so but I'm out my kids and 
they're safe and thank you guys so much like
