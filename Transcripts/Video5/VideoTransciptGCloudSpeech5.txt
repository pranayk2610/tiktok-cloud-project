I'm getting ripped tonight I'll repeat up did you know that women kill their abusers to spend roughly fifteen years incarcerated whereas men who killed their female Partners only serves roughly 26 years did you also know that 90% of women who are in jail for killing a man are abused by that same man I know some of you may be like. Although this is true why is it that women are punished far more harshly than men are here's something else to take a job at did you know that Paper Trails or evidence of you know like pictures and videos or any documentation of abuse it was not admissible in a court you cannot use it up until recently so if I were or someone else were to kill their abuser because their life was threatened and still going to prison my life doesn't matter as much as his
