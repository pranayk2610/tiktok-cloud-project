i'm getting ripped tonight alright peter did you know that women who kill their abusers spend roughly fifteen years incarcerated where as men who kill their female partners only serve roughly two to six years did you also know that ninety percent of women who are in jail for killing a man are abused by that same man i know some of you may be like murderers murder although this is true why is it that when men are punished far more harshly than men are and here's something else to take a job at did you know that paper trails or evidence of you know like pictures videos or any documentation of abuse it was not admissible in a court you can not use it up until recently so if i were or someone else were to kill their abuser because their life was grand and still going to prison my life doesn't matter as much as him
