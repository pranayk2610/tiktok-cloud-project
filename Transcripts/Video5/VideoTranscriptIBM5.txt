erection I all right P. that 
did you know that women who kill their abusers to spend roughly 
fifteen years incarcerated where as men who kill their female 
partners only serve roughly two six years did you also know that 
ninety percent of the women who are in jail for killing a man are 
abused by that same man I know some of you may be like well murder is murder 
although this is true why is it that women are punished far more harshly 
than men are and here's something else to take a jab at did you know that paper 
trails or evidence of you know like pictures videos or any documentation of abuse 
it was not visible in the court you cannot use it up until recently 
so if I work or someone else were to kill their abuser because their life was threatened 
I'm still going to prison my life doesn't matter as much as his
