I'm getting ripped tonight R I P that did you know that women who kill 
their abusers spend roughly fifteen years incarcerated whereas men who 
kill their female Partners only serve roughly 2-6 years did you also know 
that 90% of women who are in jail for killing a man are abused by that same 
man I know some of you may be like well murder is murder. Although this is true
why is it that 
women are punished far more harshly than men are and here's something else to 
take a jab at did you know that Paper Trails or evidence of you know like 
pictures and videos or any documentation of abuse it was not admissible in a 
court you could not use it up until recently so if I were or someone else were to 
kill their abuser because their life was threatened i'm still going to prison my 
life doesn't matter as much as his
