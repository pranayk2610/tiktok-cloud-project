what to say if someone insults you before I tell you the perfect response 
let's talk about what not to say never get defensive because when you get 
defensive you actually validate the other person's insult instead simply 
say excuse me and let them fill the silence they're either going to back pedal 
and try to rectify what they said or they're gonna blow up all together 
in which case you can just say okay by not feeding into the insult you're going to come 
across a lot more composed which actually invalidates the other person tap that plus sign
to follow for more and good luck
