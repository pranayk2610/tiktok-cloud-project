what to say if someone insults you before I tell you the perfect response let's talk about what not to say never gets expensive because when you get defensive you actually validate the other person's and instead simply say excuse me and let them fill the silence they're either going to backpedal and try and rectify what they said they're going to blow up all together in which case you can just say okay in a feeding into the insulting to come across a lot more composed which actually invalidates the other person got that plus sign to follow for more and good luck
