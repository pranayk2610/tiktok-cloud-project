what you say it's someone insults you before i tell you the perfect response about what not to say never get defensive because when you defensive you actually validate the other person's insult instead simply say scuse me then let them fill the silence and trying to rectify what they said or they're gonna blow up altogether in which case you can just say ok which actually invalidates the other person but that plus time to fall for more and good luck
