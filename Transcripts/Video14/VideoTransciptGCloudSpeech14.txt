kind of a sensitive topic but I want to just put it out there if a man ever hits you do not ever think that is going to be his last time you need to get out of that situation right now for man ever by any means put his hands on you in a way to hurt you get out of that situation because any man who puts his hands on you clearly does not have respect for his mother or any other woman in his life Oggy for damn sure don't have no respect for himself because any man who respects himself and respects his mother is not going to put his hands on a girl who he loves and if you think that's okay because he loves you you need a reality check cuz no man is going to put his hands on a female he loves know that
