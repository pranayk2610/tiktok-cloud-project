kind of a sensitive topic but i want to just put it out there man ever hits you you do not ever think that it's going to be his last time you need to get out of that situation right now if a man ever by any means puts his hands on you and a way to hurt you get out of that situation because any man who puts his hands on you clearly does not have respect for his mother or any other woman in his life and he for damn sure don't have no respect for him so because any man who respects himself and respects his mother is not gonna put his hands on a girl who he loves van if you think that's okay because he loves you a you need a reality check cuz no man is gonna put his hands on a female he loves no that
