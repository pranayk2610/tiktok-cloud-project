kind of a sensitive topic but I want to just put it out 
if a man ever hits you do not everything that is going to last time so you need to get out of that 
situation right now for man ever by any means puts his hands on you in a way to hurt you 
get out of that situation because any man who puts his hands are you 
clearly does not have respect for his mother or any other woman in his life 
he for damn sure don't have no respect for her so because any man who respects himself 
and respects his mother's not going put his hands on a girl we love 
and if you think that's okay because he loves you 
you need a reality check because no man is going to put his hands on a female he loves 
no that
